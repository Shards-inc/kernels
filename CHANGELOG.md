## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a production-grade HPC CI/CD architecture reference document covering deterministic build strategy, GPU matrix validation, release gating, and scaling guidance.
- Added `scripts/org_repo_review.py` to automate organisation-wide repository cloning, lint/type/test/security execution, and consolidated report generation.
- Added new GitHub Actions workflows for expanded HPC matrix validation, dedicated GPU hardware testing, benchmark regression gating, and docs build verification.
- Added a benchmark regression check utility script with baseline support to enforce latency performance thresholds in CI.
- Added MkDocs configuration to enable strict documentation build checks in CI.
- Added a scheduled dependency health workflow that validates installation integrity, runs `pip check`, audits vulnerabilities with `pip-audit`, and verifies package imports across Python 3.9-3.12.
- Added a weekly dependency canary workflow that upgrades core quality tooling to latest versions and runs lint, type checks, tests, and package build validation.
- Expanded CI workflow to run a Python 3.9-3.12 matrix with linting, format checks, type checking, security scanning, coverage-enforced tests, smoke verification, and package build validation.
- Added dedicated smoke workflow for pull requests and manual dispatch execution.
- Added thread-safe nonce registry reference implementation with TTL cleanup support and observability metrics via `stats()`.
- Added SQLite audit storage reference implementation with append/list operations and service diagnostics through `health()`.
- Added coverage tests for the reference implementations.
- Added developer automation improvements to the Makefile for formatting checks, smoke tests, dependency scanning, and build verification.

### Changed

- Extended the security workflow with dependency review, CodeQL scheduling, vulnerability scans (`safety` and `pip-audit`), and secret scanning using gitleaks.
- Extended smoke script coverage to execute reference implementation runtime checks.
- Updated release workflow to verify distribution metadata with `twine check` before PyPI publishing.
